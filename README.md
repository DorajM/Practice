Practice question on Heart Dataset
Hello Everyone, this dataset has got a lot of things to explore but I am not going to make it a lengthy one. In order to do so I am only going to solve the questions below. So, let's get started**

1.How many are suffering from heart disease? Also plot the stats.
2.How many males and females have heart disease out of total?
3.Visualize frequency distribution of the thalach variable and find what's the heart rate and heart disease relation?
4.Find correlation matrix for all the variables with target.
5.Find Mean,Min & Max of age and plot its distribution.
6.Age and its relation to heart disease. Are young people more prone to heart disease?
7.Plot chest pain type pie chart.
8.What is the max heart rate achieved in non heart disease patients?
